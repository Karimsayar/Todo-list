# Todo-list 


The task at hand is to create a todo list application using React, leveraging state hooks and function components. The application should allow users to perform actions such as adding new todos, deleting todos, and marking todos as "rush" tasks. When a todo is marked as "rush," it should be visually distinguished with different styles and displayed at the top of the list. Additionally, the application should handle historical data by not completely removing deleted todos but instead marking them as "isDeleted" to preserve their information. These todos can be utilized in future expansions, such as implementing a "Done Todos" section to display completed items.

To run the application, you can download the source code as a zip folder or fork it on GitHub and clone it to your local machine. Run the command "npm install" to install all the dependencies, and then use "npm start" to launch the application in your web browser.

In terms of future improvements, you could consider enhancing the user interface to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly. Additionally, you might want to incorporate features like tracking the number of pending todos and adding a section to view completed todos.
